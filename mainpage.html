      <h3>Avatar Builder <small>The official Winter Storm &reg Character Creator!</small></h3>
      
      <p>Welcome, and thank you for choosing Winter Storm - the first action RPG to put YOU right in the middle of the action! Thanks to our unique, state-of-the-art virtual reality technology, you will feel as if you are really there, in the world. No screen, no controller, - just you and the action. </p>
 
      <p>At the beginning of the game, you create a character. This character can be as similar or different to your true self as you wish. While inside the game, you will essentially be this character - in terms of appearance and even skills. This is achieved through our patented Character Augmentation Suite: it doesn't matter if you can't shoot straight in real life. If you build an expert gunslinger, you will be able to experience the thrill of firing that impossible shot and still hitting your target! Want to max out your listening skill? The game will seamlessly add a filter to your audio input to allow you to hear with near-perfect clarity! This is your chance to become an expert in anything, without any of the hard work! Try out our Avatar Builder today to explore your options.</p>
      <p>Please note - if you choose a body type significantly different to your own (i.e. more than 3" difference in height, or a different gender), you may feel some disorientation when you first enter the game. Our trials indicate this fades after about 15 minutes. If you do continue to experience disorientation or discomfort, please contact your designated Games Master to request an Avatar change. <small>(Avatar changes are granted at the Games Master's discretion. Depending on circumstances there may be a minor cost for the service.)</small></p>
      
       <p>While your appearance, skills and even character traits will be different, your morals and actions are still your own while in the game. Despite this, remember: the true challenge of an RPG is to act your character, no matter what. This is a chance to become someone completely different - so make the most of it!</p>
       
<h4>Using the Avatar Builder</h4>
	<p>To create a character, use the tabs along the top. Begin with your attributes, then move on to skills. Finally, add a selection of traits (or write your own!<sup>*</sup>) to your character.</p>
	<p><small><sup>*</sup>custom traits must be manually approved by your designated Games Master before play</small></p>
